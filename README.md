# RelativeStrengthVariability
Code for paper: Relative strength variability measures for brain structural connectomes and their relationship with cognitive functioning
- `NodeRelativeStrengthVariability.m` is used for computing the RSV and hierarchical RSV measures
- `GSRegressResid.m` is for extracting incremental contribution in predicting $g$ in the progressive models
- `LRAMissing.m`, Low-rank Approximation, is used in extracting the g-factor for incomplete data
- `Hierarchical3D_v2.m` is the code for generating hierarchical complexity measure presented in *The complex hierarchical topology of eeg functional connectivity*
- `local_assortativity.m` is for computing the local assortativity
